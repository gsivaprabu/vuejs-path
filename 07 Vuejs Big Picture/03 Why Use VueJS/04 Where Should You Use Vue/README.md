## When should you modernize your legacy application with VUE ?

- Simple Changes (especially to the view layer) take along time and are so complicated, only senior devs can do them
- Request for a new features in the view layer are denied because "implementing them would be too difficult" or because making the change "might break something else"
- Application code is all ad-hoc (No consistent use of frameworks or best practices), new developers have to learn how everything works from the ground up.
