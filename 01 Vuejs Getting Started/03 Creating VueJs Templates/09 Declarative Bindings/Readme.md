# 09 Creating VueJs Templates - Declarative Bindings

- Created by directives
- Directives predefined functions
- Several buil-in directives
- All baked-in directives begin with "v-"
- Instead of saying "v-text", I’ll say "text directive"

### v-text Directive
	- Interpolates a property value as an HTML element’s text.
 	- If you need to bind to only part of an element, use the semantic syntax.
